This project implements a secure federated learning system for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays. By leveraging homomorphic encryption and federated learning techniques, we enable collaborative model training across multiple healthcare institutions without compromising patient privacy. The system is built upon the COVID-Net model and optimized for performance in encrypted domains.

## üîß Features

- Privacy-preserving COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays
- Federated learning across 3 simulated hospitals using AWS EC2 instances
- Homomorphic encryption for secure weight sharing using TenSEAL
- Optimized COVID-Net model for encrypted data processing
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmarking against published works

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Federated Learning Architecture

Our system follows a general federated learning architecture with the following key components:

1. Local hospital environments (5 simulated using AWS EC2 instances)
2. Central aggregator for secure weight aggregation
3. Homomorphic encryption layer using TenSEAL for privacy preservation
4. COVID-Net CXR model adapted for encrypted computations

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ColmCoffey/cxr-secure-federated.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cxr-secure-federated

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up AWS CLI and configure credentials
aws configure



## üìà Results

### Baseline Results (Covid Net CXR 2 tested on Plaintext)

```
## Test 1

Confusion matrix: 
[[194.   6.]
 [ 17. 183.]]
Sens Negative: 0.970, Positive: 0.915
PPV Negative: 0.919, Positive: 0.968
Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives)
Accuracy = 94.25%



## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- TensorFlow for model implementation
- TenSEAL for homomorphic encryption
- AWS EC2 for simulated hospital environments
- Python for scripting and data processing
